## Summary
`ampworks` is a collection of tools designed to visualize and process experimental battery data, with a focus on model-relevant analyses. It provides routines for degradation mode analysis, parameter extraction from common protocols (e.g., GITT, ICI, etc.), and more. These routines provide key properties for life and physics-based models (e.g., SPM and P2D). Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are available for some of the analyses. See a full list of the GUI-based applications by running `ampworks -h` in your terminal after installation. 

This software is in early development (Alpha), and the API may change as it matures.

## Installation
`ampworks` can be installed from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/ampworks) using the following command:

```
pip install ampworks[gui]
```

Using `[gui]` is optional. When included, the installation includes extra dependencies needed for the GUI-based applications. However, the GUIs are completely optional. Any routines that can accessed through a GUI can also be implemented in scripts or notebooks. The package will generally install faster without the extra dependencies. Note that you can always add the GUI dependencies at a later time too; they do not need to be included with the original installation of `ampworks`.

For those interested in setting up a developer and/or editable version of this software please see the directions available in the "Development" section of our [documentation](https://ampworks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development).

## Get Started
The best way to get started is by exploring the `examples` folder, which includes real datasets and demonstrates key functionality. These examples will evolve as the software progresses.

**Notes:**
* If you are new to Python, check out [Spyder IDE](https://www.spyder-ide.org/). Spyder is a powerful interactive development environment (IDE) that can make programming in Python more approachable to new users.
* Another friendly option for getting started in Python is to use [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/). We write our examples in Jupyter Notebooks since they support both markdown blocks for explanations and executable code blocks.
* Python, Spyder, and Jupyter Notebooks can be setup using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success). Anaconda provides a convenient way for new users to get started with Python due to its friendly graphical installer and environment manager.
